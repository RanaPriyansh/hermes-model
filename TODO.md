# TODO - hermes-model

Repository: https://github.com/RanaPriyansh/hermes-model.git
Canonical local path: /root/projects/hermes-model
Default branch: main
Current git summary: ## main

## Agent start protocol
1. Pull latest from origin and inspect README, package manifests, tests, and recent commits.
2. Run the fastest local validation path first. Do not guess; prove the repo works.
3. Work from top to bottom on the tasks below, committing small validated increments.
4. If blocked, update this file with the blocker, attempted fixes, and the next best move.

## Priority tasks
1. Audit the docs/system model for drift versus the actual code and remove contradictions.
2. Add one machine-checkable validation script or test for the main data/model flow.
3. Run the local setup path for hermes-model and write exact commands back into README if they are missing or stale.
4. Create or improve a smoke test so a fresh clone can prove the project works in under 5 minutes.
5. Fix the highest-leverage broken path first: install, startup, core command, or core API route.
6. Open a short WORKLOG.md or append to changelog with what changed, what still fails, and next move.

## Definition of done for the next agent session
- Fresh clone setup is documented and reproducible.
- The primary workflow has a smoke test or demo path.
- The highest-leverage blocker is fixed or isolated with evidence.
- README and this TODO file reflect reality, not aspiration.
